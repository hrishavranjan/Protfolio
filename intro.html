                        <h2>Present Journey</h2>
                        <p>Heya! I'm Hrishav, currently a third-year B.Tech CSE student at Kalinga Institute of Industrial Technology (KIIT), Bhubaneswar, India. I'm excited to share that I've created a portfolio account to showcase who I am, what I like, and what I do. I'll be regularly updating it with my latest projects and accomplishments. Soon, I'll be adding a dedicated section to highlight the projects I've worked on. Stay tuned for updates, as I will be sharing my journey, skills, and achievements. I look forward to connecting with others who share my interests in technology and innovation.</p>
                        <h2>Childhood Journey</h2> 
                        <p>As you know my name now, come with me on my childhood journey. I completed my early studies at Indian Public School in Madhubani, Bihar. Like many children, I had a bit of a naughty streak. I spent my childhood playing games with my neighbors almost every evening. I loved playing cricket, pitto, hide and seek, and many other games. Engaging in various activities was something I truly enjoyed. Those carefree days were filled with fun and adventure, and they played a significant role in shaping who I am today.</p>
                        <h2>My Education</h2>
                        <p>Now moving forward to a new track. As mentioned earlier, I hail from Madhubani where I completed my schooling at IPS. My time here was enriched with both academic excellence and participation in extracurricular activities. I have earned numerous certificates in academics and sports alike. School life in Madhubani was immensely enjoyable for me, an experience unmatched in the past and unlikely to be surpassed in the future. Visit the <a href="gallery.html" style="color: #52cd06; text-decoration: none;">Gallery</a> section on my page to view glimpses of these memorable moments.</p>
                        <h2>My achievements</h2>
                        <p>In my achievements category, I have earned numerous medals and awards. However, I do have one regret: there were opportunities where I could have given my best but chose not to. I do not feel guilty about this because I believe that what I have accomplished thus far is sufficient for my education and personal growth. Each experience, whether seized or missed, has contributed to shaping who I am today. Moving forward, I am committed to making the most of every opportunity that comes my way and continuing to grow and learn in both academic and personal spheres.</p>
                        <h2>Personal Stuffs</h2>
                        <p>Having gone through all the sections about me, I want to delve into my personal opinions and interests. Exploring new places has always intrigued me, although my travel experiences have been limited thus far. I have a deep appreciation for trying diverse cuisines, particularly spicy dishes, and I have a discerning taste for certain types of sweets. This provides a snapshot of my preferences and passions. If you're curious to learn more about me, don't hesitate to get in touch.</p>
